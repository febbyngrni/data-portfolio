## Projects
<img align="left" width="255" height="150" src="https://github.com/febbyngrni/data-portfolio/blob/main/assets/credit_risk_prediction.jpg"> **[Credit Risk Prediction](https://github.com/febbyngrni/credit-risk-prediction)** - [**Report**](https://medium.com/@febbyngrni/predicting-credit-risk-with-machine-learning-models-010f8d66beb6)

This project aims to predict potential loan defaults to help **Bank Republik** reduce Non-Performing Loans (NPL). By optimizing the credit scoring system, the model prevents high-risk borrowers from being approved. The model achieves **87% accuracy**, with an improved **recall for credit default cases from 76% to 81%**, ensuring that more high-risk applicants are correctly identified.

This project helps **HELP International**, a NGO, optimize the allocation of **$10 million** in aid by identifying countries with the highest need. Using **K-Means and DBSCAN clustering**, 167 countries were grouped based on socio-economic indicators to prioritize funding distribution.  The analysis identified **3 optimal clusters**, with **48 countries classified as high-priority** for aid.

<img align="left" width="255" height="150" src="https://github.com/febbyngrni/data-portfolio/blob/main/assets/coffee_shop_dashboard.png"> **[Coffee Shop Executive Dashboard](https://github.com/febbyngrni/coffee_shop_viz)**

This project provides **real-time revenue tracking** for **PT Kopi Kenalan**, helping executives monitor sales performance. The dashboard highlights underperforming stores and area managers to ensure revenue targets are met. The forecast indicates that the company is **on track to meet its target in 22 days**, but a decline to the lower bound of historical trends may require strategic intervention.

<img align="left" width="255" height="150" src="https://github.com/febbyngrni/data-portfolio/blob/main/assets/telco_churn.jpg"> **[Telco Churn Prediction](https://github.com/febbyngrni/telco-churn)** - [**Report**](https://medium.com/@febbyngrni/predicting-customer-churn-an-end-to-end-ml-for-telco-company-fb62d3d83e56)

This project helps **IndiHouse**, a telecom company, **predict customer churn** and implement targeted retention strategies. By identifying high-risk customers early, the company can take preventive actions. The model achieved **74% accuracy**, with a **churn recall of 72%**, ensuring better detection of at-risk customers. The solution is deployed using **AWS EC2** for real-time churn prediction.

<img align="left" width="255" height="150" src="https://github.com/febbyngrni/data-portfolio/blob/main/assets/flight_fare_prediction.jpg"> **[Flight Fare Prediction](https://github.com/febbyngrni/flight_fare_prediction)** - [**Report**](https://medium.com/@febbyngrni/flight-fare-prediction-using-machine-learning-algorithms-8971112e5997)

This project helps **EaseMyTrip**, an OTA, optimize ticket pricing using machine learning to maximize revenue and stay competitive in a fluctuating market. By predicting fares based on factors, the company can implement **dynamic pricing strategies** effectively. The Random Forest model achieved the best performance with **98% RÂ²** and **RMSE of 2668.17**, accurately capturing price variations.

<img align="left" width="255" height="150" src="https://github.com/febbyngrni/data-portfolio/blob/main/assets/customer_segmentation.jpg"> **[RFM Analysis: Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/febbyngrni/customer-segmentation)** - [**Report**](https://medium.com/@febbyngrni/customer-segmentation-using-rfm-analysis-in-retail-uk-d7f22a40a20c)

This project helps **a retail company** stabilize revenue by identifying customer segments through **RFM analysis**. By understanding purchasing behavior, the company can develop targeted marketing strategies to boost retention and sales. **K-Means clustering revealed three segments**. These insights enable personalized promotions to enhance engagement and revenue.

<img align="left" width="255" height="150" src="https://github.com/febbyngrni/data-portfolio/blob/main/assets/ab_testing.png"> **[Marketing A/B Testing](https://github.com/febbyngrni/marketing_ab_testing)** - [**Report**](https://medium.com/@febbyngrni/data-driven-marketing-ab-testing-ads-to-increase-conversions-18089917577c)

This project evaluates the effectiveness of an ad campaign by measuring its impact on conversion rates through **A/B Testing**. By comparing ad exposure to a PSA, the company aims to refine its marketing strategy for better ROI. Statistical analysis (Z-test: 6.1291, p-value: 0.0000) confirms that the **ad significantly increased conversion rates**.
