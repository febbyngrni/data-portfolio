## Projects

This project aims to predict potential loan defaults to help **Bank Republik** reduce Non-Performing Loans (NPL). By optimizing the credit scoring system, the model prevents high-risk borrowers from being approved. The model achieves **87% accuracy**, with an improved **recall for credit default cases from 0.76 to 0.81**, ensuring that more high-risk applicants are correctly identified.

This project helps **HELP International**, a NGO, optimize the allocation of **$10 million** in aid by identifying countries with the highest need. Using **K-Means and DBSCAN clustering**, 167 countries were grouped based on socio-economic indicators to prioritize funding distribution.  The analysis identified **3 optimal clusters**, with **48 countries classified as high-priority** for aid.
